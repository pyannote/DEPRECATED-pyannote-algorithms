Label tagging algorithms

They can be used to propagate labels from one ``Annotation`` (called `source`)
to another ``Annotation`` (called `target`).

They act as translation algorithms where each `target` label is either given
a unique `source` label translation or left unchanged.

    Label tagging algorithms are made of two steps:
        - first, a label mapping algorithm is applied to find the optimal

          translated using this optimal mapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mapper : any BaseMapper subclass
        Mapping algorithm used to find the optimal mapping between source and
        target labels.
